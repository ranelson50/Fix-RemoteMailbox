# Fix-RemoteMailbox

A set of Powershell functions to automate enabling remote mailboxes in hybrid environments

Fix-RemoteMailbox v1 is meant to be run from an on-premises Exchange server. Both v2 and v3 can be run from a remote workstation, but v3 is a bit more
advanced and can take multiple inputs. V3 is still a work in progress and has only been partially tested, so be cautious.
